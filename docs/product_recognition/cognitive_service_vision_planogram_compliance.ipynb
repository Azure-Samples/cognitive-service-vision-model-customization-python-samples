    "# Tutorial: Cognitive Service Vision Planogram Compliance using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tutorial about using Cognitive Service Vision Planogram Compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cognitive Service Vision Planogram Compliance are tools to check planogram compliance using planogram and product recognition result. This allows users to compare the actual arrangement of products on the shelves with the predetermined planogram, identifying any deviations and taking necessary corrective actions. The combination of accurate product recognition and retail execution KPIs empowers retailers to enhance their store layouts, improve customer experiences, and optimize sales performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, planogram compliance feature are available in **EastUS**, **West US2**, and **West Europe** regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please create a computer vision resource on Azure portal, in **EastUS**, **West US2**, or **West Europe** region, if you don't already have one.
